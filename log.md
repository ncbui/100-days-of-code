**Today's Progress**: Refactored a method on linked list class into recursion

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Linked Lists - recursive mean](00-recursive-mean.js) [[*test*](00-recursive-mean.test.js)]
